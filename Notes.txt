A Linux distro comprises of:
  - Linux Kernel
  - GNU Shell Utils
  - GUI if needed.

What's a kernel of an OS?
- It's common to all Linux distros. It provides an interface in the hardware and the software of the system.
This is the website of the Linux kernel: https://kernel.org/ - Right now it's 6.7 release.

Most of the internet servers are made up of Ubuntu or Red Hat Linux Distros.
Red hat enterprise Linux distro is used by Large companies like Banks, Telecom or Retailers.
Linus Torvalds wrote the Linux Kernel.
Android OS is actually a modified Linux Kernel.
Linux is based on Andrew Tanenbaum's MINIX which is a microkernel OS. It's also somewhat based on UNIX.

Popular Distros of Linux:
  Ubuntu
  Kali - Hacking, penetration testing. This is essential for QA guys.
  Arch
  CentOS - Community Enterprise OS(CentOS) - It's the fastest OS.
  Red Hat - It's owned by IBM, so it ain't open source. So that's IBM survived the Apple and Microsoft onslaught. They should thank Linus Torvalds for saving their ass.
  Debian - Free and Paid
  Fedora - Free and Paid
  Amazon Linux - Paid
  Linux Mint
  Raspberry Pi
  Alpine Linux

Open Source Enterprise Linux distros, they're managed by the Linux community:
  Rocky Linux
  Alma Linux

Advantages of Linux:
  FREE SOFTWARE MOVEMENT
  Secure, hence prone to less amount of attacks than Windows systems
  Light Weight - It's faster with memory and CPU usage because it's small in kernel size
  Multi User and Multi Tasking support is easily available

Windows => Linux Terminnologies:
  Admin User => Root User
  Folder => Directory
  File => File
  Application => Package

Linux Directory Structure:
Just observe this terminal o/p.
```
akshay-pawar@akshay-pawar:~$ pwd
/home/akshay-pawar
akshay-pawar@akshay-pawar:~$ cd ../..
akshay-pawar@akshay-pawar:/$ ls
bin  boot  cdrom  dell  dev  etc  home  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  snap  srv  swapfile  sys  tmp  usr  var
akshay-pawar@akshay-pawar:/$
```
As we can observe that I am not the root user so, my terminal opens up in the `/home/akshay-pawar` directory instead of the `/root` directory by default.

Everything in Linux is a file. So, every config, every setting is a file.
Following are the important directories in Linux:
  /home:
    Home directory for other users.
  /root:
    It's the home directory for root user.
  /boot:
    It contains bootable files for Linux.
  /etc:
    It contains all the config files.
  /usr:
    By default all software is installed in this directory.
  /bin:
    It contains commands used by all users.
  /sbin:
    It contains commands used by root user.
  /opt:
    Optional software application packages.
  /dev:
    This includes device files. This includes terminal, usb device or any other device attached to the system.
