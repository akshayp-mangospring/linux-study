What is YAML?
YAML is Yaml Ain't Markup Language(YAML).
YAML is a data serialization language. Just like JSON, XML. It's a standard format to transfer data. Like JSON is.
YAML files work with both extensions like `.yml` and `.yaml`.
Just like Python, YAML works on indentations and line breaks.
YAML is very similar to JSON which involves a lot of key-value pairs and data grouped together. However it's much cleaner to look at than a JSON file.

Why is YAML important?
Configuration files are all written in YAML.
It's used for almost all the DevOps Tools and Apps. Like Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Prometheus, etc.

How to write YAML?
It has got:
  Key-value pairs - Basic key-value pair like Json. The key names needs to be `camelCased` in case of multi word keys.
  Comments - Everything after `#` is ignored
  Objects - A collection of key-value pairs under one key.
  Lists - It can be a collection of key-value-pairs or objects. Or a mix of both.
  Booleans - Booleans like any other programming language. The values accepted in Booleans are: `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `on` and `off`.
  Multi-line strings - A key in Yaml file can also have multi line strings as it's value. They begin with the `|` symbol.
  Environment Variables - We can access Env variables in a Yaml file using the `$` symbol.
  Placeholders - We can access placeholders using the `{{ }}` syntax. It's used in Ansible and Helm. The values inside the placeholders will get replaced with actual values.
We can even write multiple YAML documents inside a single `.yml` file. All we have to do is to add a separator `---` which won't let the conflict of same key names arise in the same YAML file. But it ain't recommended.

Please have a look at `code/test.yml` file for getting to know YAML in real.

We have got online tools in which we can validate our YAML file before we actually use it in Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
