What's the need of a DevOps guy in a Company? What problem does he solve?
The problem that DevOps guy solves are as follows:
- Fast Delivery:
    Deploy the app as and when new releases are done of the App.
- Reduce Outages:
    Whenever the site is down bring it up
- Quicker Turnaround on Bugs in the app
- Less Capital Expenditure(Capex) and Operational Expenditure(Opex):
    Initially the companies needed to buy and maintain their own servers. Now we can simply rent a swerver fom a Cloud Providr for less than 10% price of maintaining an independent server.
- Monitoring:
    Monitor the load on the site and manage the load efficiently, so that the site doesn't go down.

In the SDLC we have got the Post Software Development stages to get the App live, that's where the DevOps guy comes in. Those stages are:
- Release:
    Pull out the code from the tag from GitHub uploaded by developers
    Tools: GitHub
- Build:
    Tools: Maven, Jenkins
- Deploy:
    Tools: Chef, Ansible, Puppet, Docker, Kubernetes
- Monitoring:
    Tools: Cloudwatch, Nagios

Need to learn all of the above tools. At least get an idea of what each thing does in the SDLC.
Maven, Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloudwatch, Nagios.
