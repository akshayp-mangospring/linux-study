Networking models are the reason that multiple devices made by different manufacturers can communicate with each other. OSI is a networking model. TCP/IP is another networking model. Computer manufacturers and OS guys had to implement these networking models into their systems.

Physical Layer - Ethernet Cables, Network Cards
Data Link Layer - MAC Address
Network Layer - IP Address
Transport Layer
Application Layer

Rule of Thumb:
Every machine which can be networked has got internal IP addresses.
MAC Address - Media Access Control Address.

Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) Model:
