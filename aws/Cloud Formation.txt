The main motto of CloudFormation is Deploying and Managing Infrastructure at Scale.
It's a very powerful service. It'll provision and destroy resources through reading Code!!!
CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infra, for any resources.
That declaration is done in CloudFormation `Templates`.
In CloudFormation we create something called as a Stack.
For Example, in it we declare:
  I want a Security Group
  I want 2 EC2 instances to use this Security Group
  I want an S3 bucket
  I want a Load Balancer in front of these machines

Sample Template:
```
Resources:
  MyInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: us-east-1a
      ImageId: ami-a4c7edb2
      InstanceType: t2.micro
```

Reading this template, CloudFormation will create all these resources for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration you specify.

Benefits of CloudFormation:
  Infrastructure as Code:
    No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control.
    Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code.
  Cost:
    Each resource within the stack is tagged with an identifier so that you can easily see how much each stack costs you.
    You can estimate the cost of your resources using the CloudFormation template.
  Productivity:
    You can destroy and recreate your infrastructure on the fly.
    Application Composer - Automated generation of diagrams on your template. Specifies all the resources. We can see relations between all the resources.
    Declarative - No need to figure out ordering and orchestration like ECS, because it's already in order.
  DRY:
    Leverage existing templates on the Web.
    Leverage the documentation.
  Every service specified in the SA Course is supported in CloudFormation.

Service Roles:
  These are IAM Roles which you create which are dedicated to the CloudFormation service.
  IAM role which allows CloudFormation to CRUD Stack resources on your behalf.
  In these roles we can specify which users can spin up Stacks related to which resources.
  Suppose we have an IAM role which only has access to S3, then we can't spin up EC2 instances using a CloudFormation Template.
