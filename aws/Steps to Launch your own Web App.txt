Step 1:
  Create an EC2 instance
  SSH in the EC2 instance
  Upgrade all the existing software.
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt upgrade
  Install all the necessary dependencies in your EC2 instance.
    - Node JS
Step 2:
  Create an RDS instance.
  Connect it to your EC2 instance.
Step 3:
  Pull your Github Repos in the EC2 instance.
  Make the necessary edits in the `.env` files for pointing to the Public IP of the EC2 instance and RDS instance End point.
Step 4:
  Run the migrations on your DB instance.
Step 5:
  Make the Back End server up and running in the background.
    - npm install -g pm2
    - pm2 start index.js
    - pm2 startup
    - pm2 save
  Make the Front End server up and running in the background.
    - npm install -g serve
    - nohup serve -s build > serve.log 2>&1 &
Step 6:
  Install nginx to move the traffic from 80 port to your server port - 3000 in my case
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/dipakc.in.net
  Put the below code in the file for port forwarding.
    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name dipakc.in.net;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
      }
    }
  Reload the nginx configurations.
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dipakc.in.net /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    sudo nginx -t
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
Step 7:
  Create a hosted zone for your domain.
  Create an A Record with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
  Add the name server entries in the Website from which you bought the domain.
Step 8:
  Rejoice! Site is live!
