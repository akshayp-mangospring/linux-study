It's an AWS Session Manager Service.
Quickly access your Windows and Linux instances.
It allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 instance and On-Premises Server.
Each EC2 instance has a SSM Agent in it. We can connect to an EC2 instance using the EC2 Instance Role. We don't even need to enable SSH ports for this.

There are 3 ways to access your EC2 instances:
  SSH using terminal
  EC2 instance connect
  Session Manager

  Out of which SSH, Instance connect, both require the port 22 to be open in the instance, but Session Manager doesn't.

Systems Manager - Run Command:
  Execute a Document or just run a command.
  Run commands across multiple instances using Instance Groups.
  No need for SSH.
  Command output can be sent to S3 or CloudWatch Logs as per the need.

  Integrated with IAM, CloudTrail.
  It can be invoked using Event Bridge.

  Simplifies common maintenance, deployment tasks of EC2 instances and other AWS resources.
