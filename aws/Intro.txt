In Cloud Practitioner, we only study about S3 and EC2, nothing else. But in Solutions Architect Associate, we study about a lot more services.
Just keep in mind, that all the services are linked and interconnected to each other.

Right now: Netflix, Dropbox, Airbnb, NASA, Activision, McDonald's uses AWS for the Cloud Storage - That's Amazing!!!
SQS, S3 and EC2 all were launched in 2006 as part of their initial release - 1.0.
