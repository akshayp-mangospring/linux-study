This exam will focus on architecting an application. I'll be studying over 30 AWS services. Brace yourself, it's gonna change your life. It's gonna be Revolutionary!!!

The topics to focus upon:
  IAM and AWS CLI
  EC2
  S3
  Route 53
  RDS, Aurora, ElastiCache
  Serverless
  SNS, SQS, Kinesis, Active MQ
  CloudFront
  S3 Security
  VPC
  Whitepapers

In Cloud Practitioner, we only study about S3 and EC2, nothing else. But in Solutions Architect Associate, we study about a lot more services.
Just keep in mind, that all the services are linked and interconnected to each other.
