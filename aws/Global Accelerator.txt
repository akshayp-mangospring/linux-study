The AWS Global Accelerator utilizes the AWS Global Infra.
The AWS Global Infra is highly optimized for high throughput and low latency.
It can be used for assigning Elastic IP addresses.
It can also operate upon UDP Protocol, rather than the regular HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
Global Accelerator is a suitable option in cases of cross regional traffic handling, because mostly the infrastructure and settings lie on Regional level.
Thus Global Accelerator makes the difference.
