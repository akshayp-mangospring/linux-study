Multi Factor Authentication(MFA):
A password that you know + A secure device that you own(Mobile phone in our case).
Thus, Password + MFA => Successful Login.

Main benefit of MFA is that even if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is still not compromised.
MFA can be with Software options:
  Google Authenticator
  Authy

MFA can be with Hardware options:
  Universal 2nd Factor(U2F) Security Key => YubiKey - Multiple root IAM users using a single hardware security key.
  SurePassID => AWS GovCloud

It's recommended to secure every AWS root account with MFA. It's a must.
