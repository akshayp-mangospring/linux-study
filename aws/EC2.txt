It's the most popular and the most important AWS offering.

EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. It is AWS's Infrastructure as a Service.
It mainly consists of:
Renting Virtual Machines - EC2
Storing data on virtual drives - Elastic Block Store - EBS
Distributing the load across machines - Elastic Load Balancing - ELB
Auto Scaling the services using an Auto Service Group - ASG

Knowing EC2 is the most important step in learning how AWS works or the Cloud works in general.

When we are configuring the EC2 instance, we need to decide upon:
  Which OS to choose - Either Linux, MacOS or Windows
  How much compute power - Cores
  How much memory - RAM
  How much storage space:
    Network attached - EBS & Elastic File System - EFS
    Hardware - EC2 instance store
  Public IP, Private IPs
  Security Groups - Firewalls
  Bootstrap script - Configure the first launch - EC2 User Data

  The above is just like buying a laptop - We choose the OS, CPU, RAM, Hard Drive. We just have a few extra things over here such as Network, Firewall and Bootup script.

EC2 User Data:
  Bootstrap means launching commands when a machine starts. It's possible to bootstrap our EC2 instances using EC2 User Data Scripts. It runs once when the system is booted.
  EC2 User data is used to automate the boot tasks such as:
    Installing updates
    Installing software
    Downloading common files from the internet, etc.

  Boot scripts run only with the root user. So, it'll require to be run as `sudo` from the SSH shell.

EC2 Instance Types:
Some of the instances are as follows:
```
t2.xlarge - 4 Cores, 16GB RAM
c5d.4xlarge - 16 Cores, 32GB RAM
m5.8xlarge - 32 Cores, 128GB RAM
r5.16xlarge - 64 Cores, 512GB RAM - Highest possible.
```
`t2.micro` instance - 750 hours/month is sufficient for the training, which has got 1 CPU core & 1GB RAM. It's storage is on the Elastic Block store. 30 GB of EBS is included in the Free Tier.

Launching an EC2 instance:
My first instance details:
Name: My First Instance
OS: Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
Architecture: 64bit-x86
Instance Type: t2.micro

Created a new Key Pair for SSH login into the instance. Downloaded it as well.
I've allowed logging in via SSH into my EC2 instance from anywhere.
Created a User Data Script to launch it, it's written in bash as follows:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello, World from my first EC2 Instance - $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/index.html
```

Here we can now view our Webpage via `index.html` that was just created via our script above.
