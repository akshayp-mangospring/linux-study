We have 3 ways to access AWS:
  AWS Management Console:
  Web Interface - Secured with a Password and MFA.

  AWS CLI:
  Protected with Access Keys.
  We can access remote servers from our local shell.

  Installed the AWS CLI:
  ```
  akshay-pawar@akshay-pawar:~/linux-study$ aws --version
  aws-cli/2.15.23 Python/3.11.6 Linux/5.15.0-97-generic exe/x86_64.ubuntu.20 prompt/off
  akshay-pawar@akshay-pawar:~/linux-study$
  ```

  AWS SDK:
  Protected with Access Keys. It's actually useful to call AWS from within our App. Just like it's been done in Service Manager.
  We can access AWS services programatically when we embed the AWS SDK in our app.

  To Do:
  Ask Sid Da, that did we use AWS SDK in Service Manager? Maybe we might also be doing it in MangoApps.

We can generate access keys with AWS Management Console - Web Interface.
Users can manage their own access keys. Access keys are just like passwords, so don't share them.
