We have 3 ways to access AWS:
  AWS Management Console - Web Interface - Secured with a Password and MFA.
  AWS CLI - Protected with Access Keys.
  AWS SDK - Protected with Access Keys. It's actually useful to call AWS from within our App. Just like it's been done in Service Manager.

  To Do:
  Ask Sid Da, that did we use AWS SDK in Service Manager?

We can generate access keys with AWS Management Console - Web Interface.
Users can manage their own access keys. Access keys are just like passwords, so don't share them.
